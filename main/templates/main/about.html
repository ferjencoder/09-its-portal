                        Hi! I'm Fernanda ü§ì, a passionate Full Stack developer specialized in JavaScript, Python, MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, React Native, and NodeJS. I love bringing my clients' ideas to life by creating fast, well-tested, and user-centered applications. Though I'm in the early stages of my career, I've honed my skills in building efficient and responsive interfaces that provide an exceptional user experience.<br>
                        When I'm not coding, I enjoy hiking, digital photography, pottery, and reading sci-fi.<br>
                        I'm a #DogLover üê∂, #TeamCoffee ‚òï, and #DarkModeAllTheWay üåô.<br>
                        I'm eager to collaborate with teams and clients where I can contribute, add value, and embrace new technologies. Whether it's joining a dynamic team or bringing a client's vision to life, I'm excited to start a new project!
